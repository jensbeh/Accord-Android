# Accord for Android

This Accord version is a Java app for Android based on the [Accord-Client](https://github.com/jensbeh/accord-client).
The app has also been specially developed for the [Accord-Server](https://github.com/jensbeh/accord-server) and offers a few functions.

**Note:** Currently it's an experiment where I've been doing a bit of experimentation with Android Java development, which means the app is currently very unfinished and has very few features. The app may be rewritten with Flutter in Dart in the future due to its flexibility and modernity.


## Usage
To try the Accord app, follow these steps:
1. Clone GitHub repository
    ```
    # Clone Git repository
    git clone https://github.com/jensbeh/Accord-Android.git
    ```
2. Ensure that Gradle and Java are correctly installed and set
3. Compile the app
4. Use the IP address of the PC on which the [Accord-Server](https://github.com/jensbeh/accord-server) is running. (Make sure that the [Accord-Server](https://github.com/jensbeh/accord-server) is running)
